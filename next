Gather the ingredients. Preheat your oven to 350 F.
Butter and flour two 9-inch cake pans. The cakes will release better if you line the bottoms of the pans with a circle of parchment paper.
In a large mixing bowl, sift the flour, sugar, and cocoa powder. Add the salt, baking powder, and baking soda, and whisk until everything is blended.
In a separate mixing bowl, combine the milk, eggs, oil, and vanilla, and whisk to combine. Then whisk in the boiling water.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until combined.
Pour the batter into your prepared pans and transfer them to the oven.
Bake for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, or with a crumb or two attached. Start testing after 27 minutes to avoid over-baking.
Cool the cakes for 10 minutes in the pans on a wire rack. Loosen the edges by running a knife along the sides, turn the cakes out onto the racks, and cool for at least another hour.
Once cool, frost with your favorite chocolate frosting recipe or other frosting of your choice.
Cake is ready.
